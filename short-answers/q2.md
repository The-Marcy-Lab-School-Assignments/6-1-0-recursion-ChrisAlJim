# Question

What type of problems are best solved using recursion?

# Answer

Problems that can be broken into sub problems or alternate approach to an iterative solution.

# Teacher Feedback
Your answer is clear and concise, but it can be more specific in describing the types of problems where recursion is particularly advantageous.

While it's true that recursion is useful for breaking down problems into sub-problems, it's important to highlight why this approach is advantageous and in what specific scenarios it excels.
You can mention specific types of problems, like tree traversal, dynamic programming, or divide-and-conquer algorithms.
