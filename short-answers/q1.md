# Question

What is a recursive function? What are "cases" that exist in recursive functions?

# Answer

A recursive function is when a function calls itself. The cases for a recursive function are "base" case and "recursive" case. Base case is a condition that is similar to a guard clause in which it makes sure the function does not call itself endlessly resulting in stack over flow. A recursive case is the part of the function that calls itself.
